Season 4 auto-pair requires the SCIP solver (used to solve integer programs).
    http://scip.zib.de/
Make a link 'scip' to the SCIP executable.

Season 3 auto-pair requires the BLOSSOM V implementation of minimum cost perfect matching.
BLOSSOM V can be obtained at
    http://pub.ist.ac.at/~vnk/software.html#BLOSSOM5
It should be unarchived into the blossom5-v2.05.src directory, and compiled.
